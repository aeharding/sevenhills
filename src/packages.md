## The fine print

 * Seven Hills Skydivers is not financially responsible for any additional repeat jump tickets or lost tickets that may be required to pass a skill level if a student does not pass to the next skill level by an Instructor or Coach.
 * Any repeat jump ticket of a level is priced at the normal going rate for that level and is not part of any original purchased package.  Tickets of the previously purchased package may be used for a repeat level as long as the redeemed jump ticket is of the same or greater value.  There shall be no refund on the difference in price between jump tickets.  All tickets will be marked for an altitude.
 * Additional jump tickets may need to be purchaced to complete the A Licence program depending on student performance.  These packages are for the minimum jumps required by USPA to receive an A License.
