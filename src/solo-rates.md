## Solo (IAD) Skydive rates to get your "A" license

One of the benefits of the [IAD](../instructor-aided-deployment) instructional method for obtaining an "A" license is how __cost effective__ it is, especially as you're first starting out. Because your first six jumps are done at a lower altitude, the plane consumes less fuel and runs for shorter times which allows us to pass the savings on to you. This allows you to get a feel for the sport without spending a lot of money relative to other methods.

The [IAD training method](../instructor-aided-deployment) is a __unique__, __special__, __proven__ and __very effective__ method that's not taught at many dropzones. It's an __excellent__ way to get your "A" license and begin your skydiving career! To learn more about becoming a licensed skydiver, [click here](../become-a-licensed-skydiver).

## Package rates

If you're sure you want to get your "A" license, we offer packages to save significantly compared to our pay-as-you-go rates.

 * We offer student jump tickets in packs of 4 low or 5 high depending on the jump altitude.
 * We offer a package deal for getting your "A" license where you can pay up front to save (with or without the First Jump Course included)

[Click here](../packages) to learn more about our package rates.

## Example pay-as-you-go rates
Below is a sample of our rates for the minimum amount of jumps required to get your "A" license. Please remember that __these rates are if you purchase each jump separately__. [We offer packages](../packages) for a lower per-jump cost.

Please note that the above rates are if you buy each jump separately (which would end up totalling $2425). __However, you can save significantly__ [by purchasing a package](../packages).

__Note:__ The above table is an example of costs to get your "A" license. Various factors, such as long breaks in training, can require repeat jumps.
