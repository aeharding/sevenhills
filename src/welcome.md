We are a not-for-profit, all volunteer, member owned and operated club just outside of Madison. We're in business to promote skydiving and introduce people to the sport by training students and performing demo jumps. Safety is our main priority and our record is second to none! We will make your first jump a safe and exciting adventure.

### New jumper?

We offer two training methods, and one is not necessarily better than the other. Which method you decide on depends more on your motivation, and what you’re interested in getting out of your skydiving experience.

The **Tandem** method is popular today, but if you’re interested in 'doing by yourself' or pursuing your skydiving license you will need to take our **Instructor Assisted Deployment** (IAD) first jump course. The decision is like, do you want to take a ride in a car or drive it. Read through the [Tandem](../tandem) and [IAD](../instructor-aided-deployment) pages for a detailed description of the two training options.
