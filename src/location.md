## From Madison, WI

We're the closest dropzone to Madison, and by far the easiest to drive to (almost all highway driving).

Simply get on __East Washington__ going away from the Capitol, continue as it turns into US-151, get off at __exit 111__ and __turn right__ onto Highway V, continue ~2 miles and __turn right again__ onto Highway 73 (the first stop sign). We're on the left half a mile down the road!
