Jump from __10,000 feet__ attached to your instructor with a parachute built for two! Go along for the ride of your life! Tandem skydiving has made it easy to enjoy the exciting sport of skydiving with a __fantastic introduction to the world of freefall__. You will be harnessed to the front of a fully licensed, professional and friendly tandem instructor. Your instructor is in charge every step of the way, from aircraft exit, to freefall, (for about __30 seconds__ at __120 MPH__!), to a __scenic canopy ride__ (about __6-8 minutes__), to a comfortable, accurate landing.

Classes are held most weekends, __late-April__ through __October__. For more fun, you can purchase a video of your entire amazing jump taken by one of our aerial photographers - which includes pre- and post-jump interviews, the climb to altitude, and of course the exit and freefall and landing. This will all be recorded in HD so that you can remember your jump for years to come. __About an hour of training.__ Train and jump on the same day.
