**June 15-18th, 2017**

Come join us for a weekend of Skydiving whether your 1st time or your 1000th, we have something for everyone. We will be having a specialty plane (**PAC750XL**) so you and your friends can go skydiving together.

We are also proud to support our troops and host Freedom Freefall on Friday 6/16, which will give veterans a chance to experience skydiving while raising awareness for PTSD and suicide.

### New jumpers

If you have never experienced the thrill of skydiving we are offering Tandem Skydives for $215 with video packages available. Groups are encouraged, bring your friends and make a day of skydiving.

We also have Plane rides on most loads going to 12,500' watching skydivers exit the plane and have a fun descent back to the ground for $50. Seats are limited, 1 per load.
