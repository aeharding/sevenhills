## Experienced jumpers ðŸ˜Ž

As a nonprofit, volunteer dropzone, experienced jumpers are the lifeblood of Seven Hills! We welcome jumpers to come out to jump, socialize, and have fun.

## Our Safety and Training Advisors

The two people below are our awesome Safety and Training advisors. Most weekends, you can find one (or both) of them at the dropzone. __Please don't hesistate__ to talk with them if you have any questions or concerns.
