* __UPPERS__: The upper winds, or winds at exit altitude. The "uppers" are often much stronger and occasionally from a different direction than ground winds.
* __UPWIND__: The direction from which the wind is blowing.
* __USPA BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOD)__: Those representatives elected by the general members of USPA every two years as set forth in the USPA By-Laws; authorized by the By-Laws to have general charge and control of the affairs, funds and property of the organization and to carry out the objectives of the organization and its By-Laws; elects officers from among current Board members. The USPA Board of Directors consists of: 1. National Directorsthose Directors elected at large by the general membership; and 2. Regional Directorsthose Directors of a specified geographical area, elected by and responsible for representing the interests of the skydivers in a Regional area.
* __USPA LICENSE__: Formal recognition that a skydiver has met a specified level of experience, skill and knowledge. There are four classes of USPA licenses: A, B, C and D. USPA licenses are recognized internationally through the FAI and exceed the minimum requirements established for each level by the FAI.

### W

* __WARP__: A CRW term that twists the canopy to decrease it flight properties.
* __WAVE OFF__: Prior to deployment a skydiver should make a clearly defined arm motion to indicate to others nearby that he is about to open his parachute. A good wave off is essential to the avoidance of deployment collisions. 
* __WAIVERS__: Exceptions to the BSRs filed by those so indicated in USPA Section 2-2.
* __WATER JUMP__: A skydive which includes landing in an open body of water.
* __WEIGHTS__: Many lighter skydivers wear a weight vest to allow them to maintain a fast fall rate. 
* __WIND DRIFT INDICATOR (WDI)__: A device used to determine the wind drift which a descending parachute will experience, so constructed as to descend at a rate comparable to a skydiver of average weight descending under a fully deployed main canopy of average specifications. Usually a weighted strip of crepe paper 10 inches wide and 20 feet long.
* __WIND LINE__: An imaginary line from the desired landing area, extending directly along the direction the wind is blowing.
* __WINDS ALOFT__: See uppers.
* __WING LOADING__: The ratio of weight born by a wing to its surface area. In the US, divide your exit weight in pounds by the square footage of the canopy.
* __WING SUIT__: A gliding jumpsuit designed with fabric membranes between the legs of the jumper and from each arm to the torso.
* __WUFFO__: Skydiver slang for people who don't jump, from "Wuffo you jump out of them planes?"

### Z

* __ZERO-P (ZP)__: (Zero Porosity) Non-porous to air. (Not technically the correct term, but it's the one Skydivers use). Air does not go through it making ZP Canopies very efficient wings. Common slang for a type of fabric relatively impermeable to air. The less air that flows through the fabric wing of a ram air parachute, the more efficiently it flies. 
* __ZOO__: A jump that didn’t go quite as planned!
* __ZOO-LOAD__: A group going to jump that probably won’t go quite as planned!
