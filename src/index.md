## Welcome to Seven Hills &mdash; Skydiving near Madison since 1962

We're the __closest skydive center to Madison__ offering [tandem](tandem-skydiving-wisconsin) jumps, [solo](solo-skydiving-wisconsin) jumps as well as [a training program](learn-to-skydive) to become a licensed skydiver. We also serve the Wisconsin Dells, Milwaukee, Janesville, La Crosse, and Appleton &mdash; only a short drive away, and we frequently see people from all over Wisconsin.

Seven Hills is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization being volunteer owned and operated [for over 55 years](about-us). Our highly experienced [USPA certified instructors and staff](who-we-are) are here to spread the excitement of skydiving to others. At Seven Hills, __skydiving is what we love__. It's _not_ a job.

As a small skydive operation, we provide a __more relaxed__ and __more family friendly__ atmosphere than other dropzones in Wisconsin. You won't feel intimidated by a lot of faces, and you're not going to be rushed through the jump. When you call us, you speak directly with one of our skydive instructors.

## New jumper?

We offer two training methods, and one is not necessarily better than the other. Which method you decide on depends more on your motivation, and what you’re interested in getting out of your skydiving experience.

The **Tandem** method is popular today, but if you’re interested in 'doing by yourself' or pursuing your skydiving license you will need to take our **Instructor Assisted Deployment** (IAD) first jump course. The decision is like, do you want to take a ride in a car or drive it. Read through the [Tandem](../tandem-skydiving-wisconsin) and [IAD](../solo-skydiving-wisconsin) pages for a detailed description of the two training options.
