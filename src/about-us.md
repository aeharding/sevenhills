## More about us

Since 1962, Seven Hills Skydivers has been jumping out of airplanes. We are a __not-for-profit__, all __volunteer__, __member owned and operated__ club only __30 minutes outside of Madison__. We're here to promote skydiving and introduce people to the sport by training students and performing demo jumps. Safety is our main priority and our record is second to none!

Seven Hills is much more than skydiving - at Seven Hills, you're part of our sky family. Any licensed skydiver has the opportunity to become a Seven Hills member and to __make a real impact on the club__ by voting on club business and volunteering. All of our members are passionate about skydiving and volunteer their time to share the excitement of skydiving with others.

Being a nonprofit organization lets us put safety above all else. We are a __group member__ of the [United States Parachute Association](https://uspa.org/) (USPA), and _all_ instructors and coaches at Seven Hills have current USPA ratings and are certified for Instructor Aided Deployment and Tandem skydiving. Seven Hills' instructional staff includes skydivers in the sport for __decades__ with __thousands__ of skydives and holding __world records__. We also use __state-of-the-art__, modern [Aerodyne](https://www.flyaerodyne.com/icons/icon-student/) and [United Parachute Technologies](http://www.uptvector.com/) containers.

Just as well, many of our instructors started as students here. It's up to you how far you want your skydiving career to go, and whether one jump or 10,000, we can help you achieve your goals.

_There is absolutely nothing like the feeling you get when you make your first skydive!_ Skydiving at 7 Hills in Madison, Wisconsin is more than jumping out of an airplane. _It's stepping out into a different world_, a world of human flight, where you can actually __FLY__! Cars and houses disappear and plots of land make a giant checkerboard on the earth below looking like part of a vast oil painting. Try it once and you will never be the same! Whenever you look skyward, you'll want to be up there. Come jump with the skydivers that do it for the love of the sport! __Go for it!__ We look forward to seeing you at Seven Hills - blue skies! üòÅ
