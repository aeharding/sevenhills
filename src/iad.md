Instructor Assisted Deployment (IAD) is a training method that opens your parachute almost immediately upon leaving the aircraft (about 3-4 seconds of freefall). You are never attached to the plane (like static-line) and the deployment sequence is identical to the way experienced skydivers open their own parachutes. This thrilling, solo, 'do it by yourself' method is also a way to train to become a licensed skydiver. Well over half of our students choose the IAD jump, even if they want to only jump once.

Classes are held on various Saturdays (reservations required), late-April through early-October. The class starts at 8 a.m., rain or shine. You'll be jumping in the afternoon (from 3500 feet!), weather permitting, so plan on spending the whole day. Radio contact assists you in landing your parachute safely (about 4-6 minute canopy ride). A HD digital color video of your exit is available for purchase so that you can remember your jump for years to come. Train and jump on the same day.
