## Become a licensed skydiver

Making your first skydive is a life-changing experience. Chances are, if you're here, then you're asking yourself _"But what now?!"_ Well, Seven Hills has you covered! We offer a __comprehensive__, __affordable__ student program to get you all the way to your A-License. An A-License will grant you the freedom to jump _anywhere in the world_!

## The IAD Student Program

We follow the [IAD student progression](../instructor-aided-deployment) for training students at Seven Hills (at Seven Hills, it's also called the ["solo" progression](../instructor-aided-deployment)). This is an "ease you into it" type of progression, meaning you start at lower altitudes while you practice deploying your parachute. Once you demonstrate that you can deploy your own parachute safely, then we work our way up to __10,000 feet__ where you will learn freefall maneuvers like __turns__, __flips__, __barrel-rolls__, and __formation skydiving__.

## The Jumps

 * __2 IAD deployments__ where you focus on good body position and control (your first IAD jump counts for one of these!)
 * At least __three practice pilot chute throws__ (PPCTs). PPCTs build your muscle memory for deploying a parachute safely
 * __One clear and pull__ - deploy your parachute yourself without any instructor help!
 * __2 10 second freefalls__ - experience your first extended freefall as you work on maintaining a heading in freefall and demonstrate a safe deployment
 * __2 15 second freefalls__ - from here on out you will jump with a coach next to you in freefall while you work on turns and other freefall maneuvers
 * __2 30 second freefalls__ - continue freefall amneuvers
 * __All the way up!__ You will conduct the rest of your jumps from __10,000 feet__ - a __45 second freefall__! You will work on freefall maneuvers until you demonstrate that you can move around safely in freefall.
 * __Check Dive!__ After you complete at least __25__ skydives demonstrating many different freefall and parachute maneuvers an instructor will take you up on your final dive as a student. Perform a timed sequence of flips, barrel rolls, docking, and tracking and earn your A-License!

## Take your first jump

It seems like a lot - but don't worry! We will walk you through each jump, starting at #1, at your own pace. If you're interested in becoming a licensed skydiver and are interested in your first solo skydive, check out the first jump page [here](../instructor-aided-deployment). You can also call us with any questions at (608) 244 - 5252.

## Beyond the A-license

Once you become an A-licensed skydiver, you have the opportunity to jump almost anywhere. However, we will work with you to refine your skills, earn more advanced licenses (B, C, and D), enter skydiving specialties (like wingsuiting, freeflying, etc) and help you throughout your skydiving career.
