<li><strong>CROSS CONNECTORS</strong>:  Straps attached to the risers. For CRW they should be from front to rear only, to prevent the docked jumper from sliding back up the lines. Especially important for plane formations. Also used with some RSL systems and attached from side to side to prevent premature reserve deployment if only one riser is released.</li>
<li><strong>CROSS PORTS</strong>:  Vents or holes cut in ram-air canopy ribs of a cell that allow air flow from one cell to another to ensure even pressurization of the canopy.</li>
<li><strong>CROSSWIND</strong>:  Perpendicular to the direction of the wind.</li>
