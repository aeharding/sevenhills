<li><em>Absolutely loved the experience and was happier than ever that my mother and I went to Seven Hills to skydive for the first time. The workers there were very understanding and explained everything in great detail. I would highly recommend going there to skydive. Also want to give a shoutout to Bad Andy for making my experience great! Thank you so much Seven Hills!</em> <strong>- Tiff Whitt</strong><br><br></li>
<li><em>My first skydiving experience was incredible! I am so filled with gratitude and bliss after this amazing experience! Everyone I encountered at Seven Hills were friendly, encouraging, and professional. The perfect balance of light-hearted and serious to help you feel at ease. 
My tandem instructor, Dewey, explained things so thoroughly, going over the procedures until he sensed I was comfortable and showed me all of the amazing safety features on the parachute. He was informative, professional, and the perfect balance of confidence. I had total trust in the experience! 
I would recommend Seven Hills Skydivers without reservation to anyone!</em> <strong>- Fearn Rebecca</strong><br><br></li>
<li><em>I can&#39;t say enough about the Seven Hills crew. I&#39;ve been to their Head to the Hills event for a few years now and am never disappointed. This year they hosted a special event for veterans and I was grateful to be able to witness the tandem jumpers reactions. 
This is an amazing place for your first jump, or just to spectate. It&#39;s a family atmosphere and they will treat you like family.
And after you make that first jump...you ARE family!!</em> <strong>- Missy School-Keough</strong><br><br></li>
