      <div><h3 id="about-us">About us</h3>
<p>Since 1962, Seven Hills Skydivers has been jumping out of airplanes. We are a not-for-profit, all volunteer, member owned and operated club only 30 minutes outside of Madison. We&#39;re here to promote skydiving and introduce people to the sport by training students and performing demo jumps. Safety is our main priority and our record is second to none!</p>
<p>Seven Hills is much more than skydiving - at Seven Hills, you&#39;re part of our sky family. Any licensed skydiver has the opportunity to become a Seven Hills member and to make a real impact on the club by voting on club business and volunteering. All of our members are passionate about skydiving and volunteer their time to share the excitement of skydiving with others.</p>
<p>Being a nonprofit organization lets us put safety above all else. All instructors and coaches at Seven Hills have current United States Parachute Association ratings and are certified for Instructor Aided Deployment and Tandem skydiving. Seven Hills&#39; instructional staff includes skydivers in the sport for decades with thousands of skydives and holding world records.</p>
<p>Just as well, many of our instructors started as students here. It&#39;s up to you how far you want your skydiving career to go, and whether one jump or 10,000, we can help you achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the site, and feel free to look around. For first time jumpers, we offer solo and tandem skydives. Click on an option in the navigation bar above to learn more. We look forward to seeing you at Seven Hills - blue skies! üòÅ</p>
<p><i>Sincerely,<br>
Greg Porter<br>
Seven Hills President</i></p>
